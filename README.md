# Husky-Maps---Java
Using provided code and APIs for a program named HuskyMaps, I implemented the Rastering function, and the bounding boxes for the online web program. The goal of this project was to experience the feeling of working on a real-world project, and to experience working with pre-existing code that someone else wrote.
